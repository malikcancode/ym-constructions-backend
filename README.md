## 📦 Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with nodemon
- `npm test` - Run tests (not configured yet)

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is deployed on Vercel. The deployment automatically triggers on push to the main branch.

### Environment Variables on Vercel

Make sure to set these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

- `MONGODB_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `NODE_ENV=production`

## 🔒 Authentication Flow
